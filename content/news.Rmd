# Calibration belt

With [package givitiR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/givitiR/vignettes/givitiR.html) a calibration belt can be
plotted to assess the calibration of dichotomous outcome models. This is assumed a better procedure compared to the
shortcomings of the Hosmer and Lemeshow test, that may become significant in large datasets, although predicted and 
observed probabilities agree well.

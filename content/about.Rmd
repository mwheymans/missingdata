My name is Martijn Heymans. I am an Assistant Professor of Applied Biostatistics 
and Missing Data Methods at the department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics 
of the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC), The Netherlands. 

My work consists of statistical consultancy, supervising PhD projects 
on methodological and clinical topics and lecturing courses in 
epidemiology and biostatistics for the bachelor and Master's Programme 
in Epidemiology [epidm.nl](https://www.epidm.nl/nl/) and Medicine.

I like to work with RStudio and try to provide solutions for applied clinical 
researchers. I have a background in Physical Therapy, Human Movement Sciences, 
Epidemiology and Medical Biostatistics.

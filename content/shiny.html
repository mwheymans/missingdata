<h1>Simple Imputation methods</h1>
<p>This app shows the effect of applying single imputation methods in the case of one outcome variable and one covariate with missing data. <a href="https://mwheymans.shinyapps.io/simpleimp/" target="_blank">Go to the app</a></p>

<div id="multiple-imputation-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Multiple Imputation (1)</h1>
<p>This app is one of several apps to explain the Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) algorithm used as basis for Multiple Imputation with the <code>mice</code> function in R (that is also implemented by SPSS version 17 and later). This app shows a convergence plot of imputations in one imputed dataset. With Multiple Imputation the procedure is repeted in several datasets. The means of the imputed values are visible on the convergende plot. The imputed values at each iteration step are visible after clicking the “Show Imputed Values” button. Missing values are imputed in one variable with missing data, i.e. the Tampa scale variable. Another variable, i.e. the Pain variable is used to generate the imputations. The results can be repeated by the user because the original dataset is downloadable and the settings for the <code>mice</code> function are <code>m=1, maxit=20 and seed=1232</code>. <a href="https://mwheymans.shinyapps.io/mianimate/" target="_blank">Go to the app</a></p>

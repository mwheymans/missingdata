description: With the [psfmi](/psfmi/) package it is possible to do backward selection for logistic regression models after Multiple Imputation (MI). For backward selection, several variable selection criteria can be used. These criteria are called the D1, D2, D3 and Median P-rule (MPR).

The different methods are described in the papers of [Marshall et al](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-57) and [Eekhout, vd Wiel and Heymans](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0404-7).  

Be aware that backward selection may result in overfitted and optimistic prediction models, see [TRIPOD](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2088542/transparent-reporting-multivariable-prediction-model-individual-prognosis-diagnosis-tripod-explanation). Backward selection should therefore be followed by internal validation of the model.

## Logistic Regression

### Pooling without BWS and method D1

```{r }

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", Outcome="Chronic",
         predictors=c("Gender", "Smoking", "Function", "JobControl",
                      "JobDemands", "SocialSupport"), method="D1")
pool_lr$RR_Model
pool_lr$multiparm

```

### Pooling with BWS and method D3

Pooling Logistic regression models over 5 imputed datasets with backward selection
using a p-value of 0.05 and as method D3 (Meng and Rubin likelihood ratio statistics).

```{r }

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", Outcome="Chronic",
         predictors=c("Gender", "Smoking", "Function", "JobControl",
                      "JobDemands", "SocialSupport"), p.crit = 0.05, method="D3")
pool_lr$RR_Model
pool_lr$multiparm

```

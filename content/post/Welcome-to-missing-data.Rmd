Missing data is present in each study, but is still not wel understood and handled, [see for example](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2012/09000/Missing_Data__A_Systematic_Review_of_How_They_Are.13.aspx){target="_blank"}. This may severely bias the study results! 

On this website you will find simple and complex missing data solutions 
concerning medical and epidemiological studies. These solutions originate 
from FAQs asked during statistical consultations or during courses.

Most examples and solutions will be concentrated on Missing Data topics. Posts may also concern  
Regression modeling, Clinical Prediction models and Spline regression modeling.

Examples are provided for applied researchers and frequenly in RStudio.  
RStudio is an open source free package with a lot of possibilities, 
making it easy to share code so that you can use the code example
and adjust it to your own needs. Applied researchers also use
other packages as SPSS, examples using that package will also be provided.  

A nice R package is the [psfmi](/psfmi/) package that I wrote. 
With the psfmi package it is possible to apply pooling or backward 
selection (BS) for logistic (psfmi_lr) or Cox regression (psfmi_coxr)
models in multiple imputed datasets in just a second! These
procedures are not implemented in standard packages as SPSS, Stata or SAS and
are therefore not available or may force the researcher to take
wrong pragmatic solutions as applying single imputation procedures first.

### Model Stability analysis

To build a prediction model you can reliably use backward selection in a data situation where 
there are enough persons that are positive and negative on the outcome compared to the number 
of potential predictors when you combine it with internal validation and model stability analysis. 

You can find more about model stability analysis in the papers of [Royston and Sauerbrei](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1536867X0900900403), [Sauerbrei and Schumacher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.4780111607), [Heymans et al.](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-7-33) and [Heinze et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.201700067)

With model stability analysis the selection of models and predictors can be evaluated. Bootstrapping 
is used to evaluate the selected models and predictors in the resampled datasets. With the
`psfmi_stab` function this evaluation of model stability can be done in multiply imputed datasets.
For normal (single) datasets, bootstrapping is applied in these datasets. For multilevel data, cluster 
bootstrapping is used [(Field)](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00593.x).

### Example of Model Stability analysis

First start with backward selection over 5 imputed datasets using a p-value of 0.05 
and method D1. With the line of code, `pool_lr$predictors_in`, information can be 
obtained from the predictors that were selected in the model at each selection step.

```{r }

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", Outcome="Chronic",
    predictors=c("Gender", "Smoking", "Function", "SocialSupport"), 
    p.crit = 0.05, method="D1", direction="BW")

pool_lr$predictors_in

```

Now apply model stability analysis. For the example 10 bootstrap samples are used, but these can easily increased to 1000. Note that this may take a while when the predictors are selected in several steps.

```{r }

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, nimp=3, impvar="Impnr", Outcome="Chronic",
    predictors=c("Gender", "Smoking", "Function", "SocialSupport"), 
    p.crit = 0.05, method="D1", direction="BW")

stab_res <- psfmi_stab(pool_lr, direction="BW", start_model = TRUE,
      boot_method = "single", nboot=10, p.crit=0.05)

stab_res

```

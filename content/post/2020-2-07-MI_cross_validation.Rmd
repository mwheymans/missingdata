With the function `psfmi_perform` of the [psfmi](https://mwheymans.github.io/psfmi/) package it is possible to combine Cross-validation with Multiple Imputation for internal validation.
<!--more-->


# Introduction

This page contains information of three methods that are implemented 
in the [`psfmi`](https://github.com/mwheymans/psfmi) package and that combine Multiple Imputation with Cross-validation for the validation of logistic prediction models. Currently the methods are only available via downloading the 
`psfmi` package via Github. Do this:

 install.packages("devtools")
 
 library(devtools)
 
 devtools::install_github("mwheymans/psfmi")
 
 library(psfmi)

The cross-validation methods are adjustments of the methods described in the 
paper of [Mertens BJ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bimj.201800289)  and [Miles A](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0049124115610345).

The methods are implemented in the function `psfmi_perform` and are called:
`cv_MI`, `cv_MI_RR` and `MI_cv_naive`. An explanation and examples of how to use the
methods can be found below. See also these Vignettes for more explanation of the methods [Vignettes](https://mwheymans.github.io/psfmi/).

# Methods

* [Method cv_MI]
* [Method cv_MI_RR]
* [Method MI_cv_naive]

# Examples

* [Method cv_MI - Example 1]
* [Method cv_MI including BW selection - Example 2]
* [Method cv_MI_RR - Example 1]
* [Method cv_MI_RR including BW selection - Example 2]
* [Method MI_cv_naive - Example 1]
* [Method MI_cv_naive including BW selection - Example 2]

## Method cv_MI

With this method imputations are implemented as part of the cross-validation
procedure. Within each cross-validation fold, imputation
is done once. By repeating this process over multiple imputation runs,
multiply imputed training and test sets are generated. Model performance 
is evaluated and tested in the training and test sets respectively.
The method can be performed in combination with backward selection
in the training set and subsequently testing the performance in the test set.
The method can only be performed when the outcome data is complete and
the original data, that contains the missing values has to be included.

### Method cv_MI - Example 1

To run the cv_MI method use:

```{r}

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

res_cv <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "cv_MI", data_orig = lbp_orig, folds=3,
                     nimp_cv = 2, p.crit=0.2, BW=TRUE, anova_test = "LRT",
                     miceImp = miceImp, printFlag = FALSE)

res_cv

```

### Method cv_MI including BW selection - Example 2

To run the cv_MI method including BW selection use:

```{r}

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

res_cv <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "cv_MI", data_orig = lbp_orig, folds=3,
                     nimp_cv = 2, p.crit=0.2, BW=TRUE, anova_test = "LRT",
                     miceImp = miceImp, printFlag = FALSE)
res_cv

```

## Method cv_MI_RR

The method cv_MI_RR uses multiple imputation within the cross-validation 
definition. The pooled model is analyzed in the training data and 
subsequently tested in the test data. The method can be performed 
in combination with backward selection of the pooled model in the training set 
and subsequently testing the performance of the pooled model in the test set. 
The method can only be performed when the outcome data is complete.

### Method cv_MI_RR - Example 1 

To run the cv_MI method use:

```{r}

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

res_cv <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "cv_MI_RR", data_orig = lbp_orig, 
                        folds = 4, nimp_mice = 5, p.crit=0.2, BW=TRUE, 
                        miceImp = miceImp, printFlag = FALSE)

### Method cv_MI_RR including BW selection - Example 2

To run the cv_MI_RR method including backward selection:

pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, formula = Chronic ~ Pain + JobDemands + rcs(Tampascale, 3) +
                   factor(Satisfaction) + Smoking, p.crit = 1, direction="FW",
                 nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", method="D1")

res_cv <- psfmi_perform(pool_lr, val_method = "cv_MI_RR", data_orig = lbp_orig, 
                        folds = 4, nimp_mice = 5, p.crit=0.2, BW=TRUE, 
                        miceImp = miceImp, printFlag = FALSE)

## Method MI_cv_naive
      
This method applies cross-validation after Multiple Imputation. The same folds
are used in each multiply imputed dataset. Is is possible to do backward 
selection during cross-validation. How this method works is visualized below.

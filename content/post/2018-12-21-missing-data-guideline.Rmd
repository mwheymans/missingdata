I have written a Missing Data guideline as part of the Research Quality handbook for all researchers within The Amsterdam Public Health research institute (collaborative research institute between the VUMC and AMC universities and Academic Hospitals in Amsterdam). This guideline may also be useful for other researchers.  

The Missing Data guideline can be found [here](http://www.emgo.nl/kc/handling-missing-data/){target="_blank"}

<p>With the psfmi_mm function pooling and selection of (generalized) linear mixed models, i.e linear and logistic mixed models, is possible. With the psfmi_stab function the stability of models after using psfmi_lr, psfmi_coxr and psfmi_mm can be evaluated. The latter function uses (single) bootstrapping for the psfmi_lr and psfmi_coxr functions and cluster bootstrapping for the psfmi_mm function. With the function the bootstrap inclusion frequency of predictors and models can be estimated. The functions are under development and can be downloaded from my github page via:</p>
<p>install.packages(“devtools”)</p>
<p>library(devtools)</p>
<p>devtools::install_github(“mwheymans/psfmi”)</p>
<p>library(psfmi)</p>
<p>Feedback to improve the functions is appreciated.</p>

description: With the [psfmi](/psfmi/) package it is possible to force variables in the model during backward selection. Be aware that backward selection may result in overfitted and optimistic prediction models, see [TRIPOD](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2088542/transparent-reporting-multivariable-prediction-model-individual-prognosis-diagnosis-tripod-explanation). Backward selection should therefore be followed by internal validation of the model.

Forcing predictors in the model can be applied by using the *keep.predictors* option in
the psfmi_lr function. These variables can be continuous, dichotomous or 
categorical variables. Also more than one variable can be forced in the model
during backward selection. Examples will be given below.

## Examples 

+ [Pooling with BS and forcing dichotomous variable in the model] 
+ [Pooling with BS and forcing categorical variable in the model]
+ [Pooling with BS and forcing dichotomous and categorical variable in the model]

### Pooling with BS and forcing dichotomous variable in the model

Pooling Logistic regression models over 5 imputed datasets with backward selection
using a p-value of 0.05 and forcing the dichotomous predictor "Smoking" in the models 
during backward selection with method D3 (Meng and Rubin likelihood ratio statistics method).

```{r }

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", Outcome="Chronic",
    predictors=c("Gender", "Smoking", "Function", "JobControl",
    "JobDemands", "SocialSupport"), keep.predictors = "Smoking",
    p.crit = 0.05, method="D3")
pool_lr$RR_Model
pool_lr$multiparm_p

```

### Pooling with BS and forcing categorical variable in the model

Pooling Logistic regression models over 5 imputed datasets with backward selection
using a p-value of 0.05 and forcing the categorical predictor "Satisfaction" in the models 
during backward selection with method D1.

```{r }

library(psfmi)
pool_lr <- psfmi_lr(data=lbpmilr, nimp=5, impvar="Impnr", Outcome="Chronic",
    predictors=c("Gender", "Smoking", "Function", "JobControl",
    "JobDemands", "SocialSupport"), cat.predictors = "Satisfaction", 
    keep.predictors = "Satisfaction",
    p.crit = 0.05, method="D1")
pool_lr$RR_Model
pool_lr$multiparm_p
